# 🏏 IPL Cricket Analytics Project

This project analyzes performance factors in the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** to explore how early-match statistics correlate with a team's chances of winning and their total runs scored. The IPL is one of the most popular T20 cricket leagues in the world, and understanding what drives match outcomes can offer valuable insights — especially for fans and analysts.

## 📊 Summary

The main goal is to investigate **early-game indicators** — the kinds of stats a viewer might notice at the beginning of a match — and evaluate whether they can be used to **predict a team’s win probability or scoring potential**.

The analysis focuses on:
- 🪙 Pregame toss outcomes
- 🏟️ Match venues and city-specific performance
- 🏏 Batting and bowling performance metrics
- 🔁 Power Play overs
- 🧱 Timing of the first wicket

From these, the project explores predictive features like:
- Average strike rate of the top 5 batsmen
- Average runs scored at a given venue
- Total runs in Power Play overs
- Over number when the first wicket falls
- Historic team win percentage

The goal is to **mimic a fan's perspective** — using early indicators to make informed guesses about a team’s potential to win, before the outcome is obvious.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Google Colab (Python, SQL)
- BigQuery (for IPL data)
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook format

## 🗒️ Note

This notebook is no longer connected to live Google Cloud services, but **all outputs and visualizations have been preserved** at the time of analysis.
